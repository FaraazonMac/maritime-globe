# Maritime Globe — Progress Log

## Project
A live 3D ship-tracking globe (React + react-globe.gl) backed by a Python FastAPI service consuming real AIS data, with three planned differentiator features: dark-fleet/sanctions detector, port congestion predictor, AI agent chat.

## Milestone log

### Session 1 — Frontend foundations
- Set up Node.js, Vite + React + TypeScript project
- Learned JSX, useState, .map(), git/GitHub basics
- Built first globe (Cesium, later switched to react-globe.gl for better look/less friction)

### Session 2 — Globe styling
- Custom SVG markers for ships (status-based), ports (anchor icon), lighthouses (triangle)
- Click-to-inspect detail panel
- Fixed pointer-events bug blocking clicks

### Session 3 — Backend foundations
- Python virtual environment, FastAPI, first `/ships` endpoint
- Connected frontend to backend via fetch() + CORS

### Session 4 — Real AIS data
- Signed up for AISStream.io, secured API key in `.env`
- Built websocket listener as a FastAPI background task
- Fixed SSL cert issue, Anaconda/venv environment confusion
- Real live ships now flowing end-to-end: AISStream → backend → frontend → globe

### Session 5 — Real-data cleanup (today)
- Added periodic refetch (ships now update every 10s, genuinely live)
- Diagnosed and fixed performance issue: switched ships from DOM-based HTML markers to WebGL `objectsData` sprites (handles hundreds of real ships smoothly)
- Built directional arrow markers using real AIS heading data, uniform sizing across zoom levels (`sizeAttenuation: false`)
- Swapped to higher-res free Earth texture
- Accepted known limitation: map blurs at extreme zoom (fixed-resolution free texture, not a bug)



### Session 6 — Dark-fleet / AIS-gap detector
- Built `dark_fleet.py`: flags any ship with no AIS update for 20+ minutes (`DARK_THRESHOLD_MINUTES`), with an honest reason string ("may have left tracked area or gone dark" — acknowledges the ambiguity)
- New `/ships/dark-fleet` endpoint; `/ships` now runs every ship through the flag check
- Wired into frontend: flagged ships render in alert red, detail panel shows a red-bordered "Dark Fleet Alert" box
- Fixed a real bug along the way: ship clicks weren't registering (`obj.userData` was being read off the wrong object — the click handler receives the ship data directly, not a wrapper)
- Extensively tested threshold behavior by temporarily lowering it to force visible flags, then restoring to 20 min

### Session 7 — Vessel type, live weather, real ports
- Backend now listens for AIS `ShipStaticData` messages (not just `PositionReport`), merging vessel type into each ship's record instead of overwriting it on every position update
- Decided against per-type ship icons on the globe (kept simple arrow/circle); vessel type shown as a "Type" row in the detail panel instead
- Live wave height per selected ship via Open-Meteo Marine API (handles inland/no-data ships gracefully)
- Replaced the 4 hardcoded ports with a live fetch of NGA's World Port Index (~3,630 real global ports) via ArcGIS REST GeoJSON

### Session 8 — Real-world infrastructure layers
- Attempted live shipyard/lighthouse/tank-storage data via OpenStreetMap's Overpass API; hit repeated timeout failures on unscoped worldwide queries across two different Overpass mirrors — concluded this was a genuine free-server capacity limit, not a bug
- Switched to curated real-data lists instead (source of truth for a resume project, matching how ports/bunkering were already handled): 55 shipyards, ~130 lighthouses, 15 ship recycling yards, 30 bunkering stations, 20 dry docks, 10 wet docks
- Built a "Map Layers" sidebar — all categories hidden by default, toggleable
- Clicking any facility marker opens a detail panel with name, country, and a real fact
- Added nearest-facility awareness: clicking a ship computes real distance (haversine) and compass bearing to the nearest port, lighthouse, shipyard, recycling yard, bunkering station, dry dock, and wet dock

### Session 9 — Port congestion predictor
- Scoped honestly as a live congestion score (count of anchored ships within 15km, classified Low/Medium/High), not a historical forecast — no historical port-call data exists to train a real predictor on
- New "Port Congestion (Live)" map layer, color-coded markers
- Built an interactive port-checker on the ship panel: shows nearest port + congestion, "Check another port →" cycles to progressively farther ports (each numbered simultaneously on the globe), "← Previous port" to go back
- Port facility panel (clicking a port directly) shows live docked-ship count, nearby traffic, and congestion level
- Added a full country-code → country-name lookup table for cleaner facility panel display

### Session 10 — AI fleet chat assistant
- New `/chat` backend endpoint using Groq's API with function-calling
- Single tool (`query_ships`) lets the model filter the live fleet by vessel type, status, dark-fleet flag, idle time, and/or proximity to any of the ~3,630 global ports (backend independently fetches the same World Port Index on startup, decoupled from the frontend's copy)
- Debugged through: wrong model name (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile` deprecated on Groq, switched to `openai/gpt-oss-120b`), a route defined before `app = FastAPI(...)` existed, a non-JSON-serializable `datetime` field, and a malformed follow-up message causing 400s
- Frontend: bottom-right toggle "Fleet Assistant" chat widget; matching ships highlight on the globe (dimming others) only when the result set is small enough to show in full — broad queries just show the text answer

### Session 11 — UI polish & bug fixes
- Removed a fixed-width `#root` CSS rule that was leaving empty space on wide screens
- Fixed a stacking-order bug where globe labels rendered on top of overlay panels
- Made the ship dimming effect apply consistently on both direct ship-click and chat highlighting
- Panel background, blur, and text-centering cleanup across all four panel types

### Session 12 — Flag/IMO/call sign, chat reliability, weather depth, UI bugs
- Added real ship identity from AIS: flag derived from the MMSI's Maritime Identification Digits (official ITU country-code table, 290 codes verified against the source list), plus IMO number and call sign captured from `ShipStaticData`
- Made the chat assistant multi-step: it can call its tools several times per question (e.g. one lookup per port when comparing), retries automatically on Groq's rate limit (429), and sends the model a compact summary instead of full ship records to stay under the token budget
- Added chat tools `port_direction` (real distance and bearing between two ports) and `find_ship` (live ship lookup by name). This fixed a bug where the model answered ship-name questions from general knowledge, e.g. treating the ship "RATINGEN" as the German town
- Chat replies now render `**bold**` as bold text and keep line breaks
- Congestion facility panel now matches the clicked marker's colour (red, amber or green)
- Built the full live weather block: wind speed, direction and gusts; sky condition with thunderstorm flag; pressure; visibility; wave height, direction and period; swell; sea temperature; and current. Switched from Open-Meteo's `hourly[0]` (which was reading midnight UTC, not now) to its `current` parameter
- Fixed a page-layout bug: `#root` only had `min-height`, so any overflow made the whole page scrollable. Locking `html`, `body` and `#root` to the viewport also stopped mouse-wheel scrolling over a panel from scrolling the page

### Session 13 — Voyage data, chat upgrades, departure tracking
- Captured Destination and ETA from AIS static data. The destination text is matched to a known port only on an exact or substantial match, with no forced guesses, and both show in the ship panel
- Built departure tracking: when a ship flips from anchored-in-port to moving, the nearest known port (within 15 km) of its previous position is logged as `departure_port` with a timestamp. It is held in memory and resets on restart. At one check, 58 ships had both a departure and a destination
- Chat assistant upgrades:
  - Conversation memory (history is sent with each message)
  - Multi-round tool calls with rate-limit retry
  - New tools: `find_ship` (by name or IMO, returns every match), `find_facility` (ports plus ~150 lighthouses, shipyards, docks and other facilities duplicated server-side), and `port_direction`
  - New filters: `has_destination` and `has_departure`
- Chat highlighting: numbered markers for 2+ facilities, ships dim, the camera frames all results, and a Clear button sits in the chat header. Clicking a ship inside a highlighted group keeps the group visible
- Fixed Groq tool-validation errors by making optional tool parameters nullable
- Built route arcs from departure to current position to destination, then removed them. For short routes they rendered as oversized wedges, and a flat-line replacement was not worth the risk. The same information stays in the panel as text
- Wrap-up: README written, `requirements.txt` generated, dead `test_ais.py` deleted, and confirmed `.env` was never committed to git

### Session 14 — Chat filters, full-set highlighting, persistent departures
- Added chat filters for flag, departure port, and destination text (`flag`, `departed_from`, `destination_contains`), so questions like "Dutch cargo ships heading to Rotterdam" are answered from the data instead of the model guessing from a 5-ship sample
- Highlighting now covers the entire result set (up to 500 ships) rather than the 20-ship sample the model sees. Ships are keyed by MMSI, so two ships with the same name no longer overwrite each other
- Added output formatting rules so replies use plain lines instead of Markdown tables the chat box can't render
- Made the model check both ships and facilities before reporting a name as not found
- Persisted the departure log to `backend/departures.json` (git-ignored). It is written when a departure is detected and reloaded on startup, so departures survive restarts
- Rotated the Groq API key after it was exposed during debugging




## Current state
- ✅ Live globe with real ships, ports, lighthouses, shipyards, recycling yards, bunkering stations, dry/wet docks (toggleable layers)
- ✅ Dark-fleet / sanctions-evasion detector
- ✅ Live port congestion score
- ✅ AI fleet chat assistant (Groq function-calling, multi-step, rate-limit-safe, with conversation memory, ship/facility lookup by name, and numbered multi-location highlighting)
- ✅ Nearest-facility distance and compass bearing on every ship
- ✅ Full live weather per ship (wind, sky, pressure, visibility, waves, swell, sea temp, current)
- ✅ Real flag (from MMSI), IMO number, and call sign per ship (where broadcast)
- ✅ Destination and ETA from AIS, plus departure port detected live when a ship leaves a known port
- ✅ Departure log persisted to disk and survives restarts
- ⬜ No operator or build-year data (no legitimate free source; Equasis requires a login and has no public API)
- ⬜ Live ship tracking is scoped to the North Sea / English Channel by choice, because of AIS coverage, render cost and payload size

## Next target
Persist the departure log to a file, add a self-check for overall system health, record the demo video, and decide on the global-ships scope.
## Next target
Build a self-check/monitoring feature that verifies the whole project is actually working (backend up, AIS feed live, ports loaded, chat reachable). Then decide on global ship tracking scope, then wrap-up tasks: `requirements.txt`, README rewrite, dead-code cleanup (test_ais.py, test_groq.py), demo video.
